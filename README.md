# jeremy bensoussan - portfolio

French dude living in Israel, I am specializing in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, after working 12 years in quantitative finance in Paris, London and Tel Aviv.
<br><br> 

## [Resume]  
üëâüèª I am currently looking for my next professional challenge. Feel free to look at my [CV]
<br><br>

## [Israel Tech Challenge]
From October 2018 to March 2019, I will be attending a professional course in Data Science, with a specialization in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision.

In this repo, you will find a selection of the exercises I found the most interesting, challenging, enriching, fun, ...

On the following topics:
  - [python] 
  - [intro to Data Science]: SQL, time series, anomaly detection...
  - [Stats]: bayesian inference, regression, statistical tests, entropy...
  - [Modelling]: Naive Bayes, KNN, Polynomial regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Ensembles, Feed Forward Neural Nets
  - [Unsupervised Learning]: Clustering, Singular Value Decomposition, Independent Component Analysis, Convex Optimization
  - [Deep Learning]: Neural Networks, CNN, LSTM
  - [Natural Language Processing]: Word Embedding, POS Tagging, Entity Extraction
<br>
  
## Packages
To create a Conda environment including all the packages needed in this portfolio run:
```bash
conda env create -f ITC.yml
```
<br>

## Dark Theme in Jupyter
For an improved visual experience run the following command (requires [jupyter-themes])
```bash
jt -t onedork -tfs 12 -nfs 12 -ofs 10 -cellw 1200 -lineh 150 -kl -N -T
```

To revert to your initial jupyter themes setting run:
```bash
jt -r
```
